## 🏨 Product Feature Impact Simulation: Hotel Price Filter
This project simulates the impact of adding a  **new price filter** feature on hotel booking behavior using the **Hotel Booking Demand Dataset**.

## 🔍 Goal
Understand how user behavior (cancellations, booking volume, pricing) changes across simulated price segments, and what this means for product decisions.

## 📊 Key Analyses
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  Understanding booking patterns, customer types, average daily rates, and cancellation trends.
  
- **Feature Simulation:**  
  Introducing a hypothetical **Price Filter Feature** (Low, Medium, High price ranges) to simulate user selection and booking outcomes.
  
- **User Segmentation:**  
  Behavior breakdown by customer type (Repeated vs. New), market segment, and hotel type.
  
- **Impact Analysis:**  
  Insights into which user groups are most sensitive to price-based filtering.

## 📈 Key Insights
- Low and medium price filters drive significantly higher booking rates, especially among **new customers**.
- City hotels exhibit more pronounced price sensitivity than resort hotels.
- Higher ADR (Average Daily Rate) bookings are more common among repeat customers who are less price-sensitive.

## 🎯 Business Recommendations
- **UX Improvement:** Prioritize and highlight price filters in search results to optimize conversion for price-sensitive users.
- **Personalization:** Use customer type to pre-select default price filters (e.g., show medium-priced options to new users).
- **Targeted Campaigns:** Focus discount offers on city hotels to capitalize on higher price sensitivity.

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Validate the simulated feature with actual A/B testing on live platforms.
- Expand segmentation to include seasonal effects and lead time analysis.
- Conduct deeper price elasticity modeling.
